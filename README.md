## NFL Big Data Bowl 2026 - Prediction Competition Summary

**Competition Focus:**
The 2026 Big Data Bowl challenges participants to predict player movement while the ball is in the air. For the first time, participants will use data from before the football is thrown to produce insights on where players will move while the football is in the air.

**Key Details:**
- This is the eighth annual Big Data Bowl, powered by Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Participants compete for a shared prize of $100,000 and the chance to present their submission to NFL teams at the 2026 NFL Scouting Combine
- Data will be available from the 2023 and 2024 NFL seasons, with predictions evaluated against outcomes from Weeks 14-18 of the current season

**New Features:**
For the first time, applicants can enter a public leaderboard, which evaluates the accuracy of submissions by comparing predicted to actual player locations as determined using Next Gen Stats.

**Competition Structure:**
There are two pathways on Kaggle:
1. **Prediction Competition** (leaderboard-based) - evaluated on prediction accuracy
2. **Analytics Competition** - includes two tracks: Metric (developing new ways to understand player movement) and Coaching Presentation (creating insights designed for coaching staffs)

Participants can work independently or in teams and are allowed to register for both competitions if interested.

**Impact:**
Previous Big Data Bowl submissions have directly influenced Next Gen Stats development, including the introduction of Coverage Responsibility this season using advanced AI and machine learning. Over 75 participants have been hired in data and analytics roles in sports, with more than 60 joining the NFL.
